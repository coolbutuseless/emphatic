Description: Tools for exploratory analysis of tabular data using colour 
  highlighting.  By specifying a palette and row/column positions, data-dependent 
  colouring can be applied to data.frames in a pipe-friendly
  manner.  Highlighting is displayed in any console supporting ANSI
  colouring. Quarto and Rmarkdown rendering are also supported.  It is 
  also possible to add colour to regular expression matches and 
  highlight differences between two objects.
